# react-selectable-wrapper

## About
Inspired by  [react-router implementation](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/packages/react-router/modules/Switch.js)  and [Enumerable mixin](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Enumerable.html) in Ruby.

Initially developed for [dooboo-ui](https://github.com/dooboolab/dooboo-ui/pull/70)(some examples and explainations here).

Currently supports React only.
React Native support and Documentation will be added soon.
